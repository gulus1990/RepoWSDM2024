The main code of impact attenuation mechanism is located at \RepoRecsysLBR2023\torch-rechub-main\torch_rechub_1\trainers\AcouRec.py

Various MTO methods are integrated at \RepoRecsysLBR2023\torch-rechub-main\torch_rechub_1\trainers\mtl_trainer.py

Apart from our paper-related content, we used Rechub for other code implementations. Refer to https://github.com/datawhalechina/torch-rechub/tree/main for usage guidance.
